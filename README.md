# NLP Course - Language Models

This repository contains the following language model implementations:

 * Laplace Smoothing for Unigrams (`python/LaplaceUnigramLanguageModel.py`)
 * Laplace Smoothing for Bigrams (`python/LaplaceBigramLanguageModel.py`)
 * Stupid Backoff (`python/StupidBackoffLanguageModel.py`)
 * Kneser-Ney (`python/CustomLanguageModel.py`)


The assignment aims to evaluate a spell correction system, but the student's job was just the implementation of the language models aforementioned.

I had a hard time with the Kneser-ney algorithm, and tried to write the respective mathematical formulas nearby the relevant lines.

Run the spell checker and get the score with the command (file provided with the assignment):

```
python SpellCorrect.py
```

If you find some error or have any suggestion, please let me know.
